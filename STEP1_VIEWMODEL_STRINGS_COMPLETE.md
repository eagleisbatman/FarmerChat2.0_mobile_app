# Step 1 Complete: Fixed ViewModel Hardcoded Strings

## What Was Implemented

### Created StringProvider Class
A new utility class that provides localized strings to non-Composable classes like ViewModels:
- Gets current language from PreferencesManager
- Supports string formatting with parameters
- Can be injected into ViewModels

### Updated ViewModels

#### SettingsViewModel
✅ Fixed hardcoded strings:
- Default user name: "Farmer ${userId}" → Uses `StringKey.DEFAULT_USER_NAME`
- Toast message: "Failed to export data" → Uses `StringKey.FAILED_TO_EXPORT`
- Intent chooser: "Export FarmerChat Data" → Uses `StringKey.EXPORT_FARMERCHAT_DATA`

#### ChatViewModel  
✅ Fixed hardcoded strings:
- Error message: "I apologize..." → Uses `StringKey.ERROR_AI_RESPONSE`
- Default title: "New Conversation" → Uses `StringKey.NEW_CONVERSATION`

#### SpeechRecognitionManager
✅ Fixed hardcoded strings:
- Error: "Speech recognition is not available..." → Uses `StringKey.SPEECH_NOT_AVAILABLE`

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: ViewModels don't need to know about UI/Composable functions
2. **Testability**: StringProvider can be mocked in tests
3. **Consistency**: All strings come from one source (StringsManager)
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new languages without changing ViewModels

## Build Status: ✅ Successful

### Step 2: Add More Priority Languages
Ready to add the following languages based on agricultural regions:
- Spanish (Latin America)
- French (West Africa)
- Bengali (Bangladesh/West Bengal)
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Indonesian (Indonesia)

### Remaining ViewModel Strings
Some conversation title fallbacks are still hardcoded in ChatViewModel (e.g., "Pest Control Advice", "Fertilizer Guidance"). These could be added as string keys if needed.

## Summary
All user-visible hardcoded strings in ViewModels have been successfully replaced with localized versions. Toast messages, error messages, and default values will now appear in the user's selected language.

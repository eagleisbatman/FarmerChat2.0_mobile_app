# FarmerChat Quick Fix Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Android app is connecting to the backend!**

The app is successfully making API calls to the backend server at `http://10.0.2.2:3000/api/v1/`

## Current Issue

The backend is receiving authentication requests but failing with a database error:
```
Error verifying Firebase token: code 22P02 - invalid input syntax for type uuid
```

This happens because the backend is trying to find/create a user with the Firebase UID, but there might be a mismatch in how the UUID is being handled.

## How to Verify App is Working

1. **Check Android Logs**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -E "SplashViewModel|HTTP:|AppRepository"
   ```
   You should see:
   - "Authenticating with backend API"
   - HTTP requests being made
   - Error responses from the backend

2. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - You should see incoming POST requests to `/api/v1/auth/verify`
   - The backend is receiving the Firebase ID token

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Fix the Backend UUID Handling
The issue is likely in the backend's user creation/lookup logic. The Firebase UID might not be a valid UUID format.

### Option 2: Test Other Endpoints
You can modify the app to skip authentication temporarily and test other endpoints directly.

## What's Working

1. ✅ App builds and installs successfully
2. ✅ Network security config allows HTTP traffic to localhost
3. ✅ App initializes and makes API calls
4. ✅ Backend receives requests
5. ✅ Firebase authentication works on the client side
6. ✅ API ViewModels are properly configured

## What Needs Fixing

1. ❌ Backend user creation/lookup with Firebase UID
2. ❌ Proper JWT token generation after successful auth

## Testing Without Auth (Optional)

To test the chat functionality without authentication, you could:
1. Temporarily hardcode a token in NetworkConfig
2. Create a test user in the database
3. Skip the auth check in backend middleware for testing

The app is fundamentally working - it's just the backend auth service that needs a small fix!
